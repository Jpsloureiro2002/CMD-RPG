# CMD-RPG
<h1>Welcome to <b>MATH GAME</b></h1>
<p>
It started with a simple project of a text-based rpg but over time before I even opened this repository around 2018. Now I make the game with the goal of learning and improving.

<h2>How it works:</h2>
The project is still under development so I don't have much to say yet but I can at least tell you how it works, let's start with the basics:

-All actions in the game are turn based like walking, battles and simply doing nothing will cost you a turn.
-All actions in the game are done through commands like if you want to walk you have to type w,a,s,d and press enter(O because it is simple I want to avoid using external code like libraries for now I have only used 5 of which 3 are already from python itself but I could remove that by simply using a "while" every time but what fun would that be :P)
-For each level there is a map drawn with basic colors that are then converted to the Prompt so you can create and add maps easily I will leave an example map in the future.
- That's all for now, I don't want to write much more about it, I'll do it and then add things here :)
